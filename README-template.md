## Overview
- This is my first time creating a small project of my own, although it is considered easy, i realized i still have a long way to go in Web Development. The project as a whole brought challenges i could not solve without watching videos. a project like should take an hour at most, but for me took several days. to me, i do not see this as a bad perspective but as a good one, i am aware of where i am at and i need to fix that. i am not only motivated but worthy for the next project to tackle.

### The challenge
- The hardest challenge was fixating the background to a certain degree. Another challenge that brought to my attention was the profile image, from where it should go, either outside the card body div or inside the header div, or on between both.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a few little details, such as how a background properties go about. in html i learned its very important how to you create your tags because it determines how it will function within your css file, issues such as parent and child/descendant. 

### Continued development

Adding SASS concepts to this project even though it was not necessary was mainly to get comfortable with it that way in the future i can tackle bigger projects with much more ease. As a beginner, im well aware how important is it know the width and height properties in depth, so for the next project i wont just use the regular width and height, when theres properties such as max/min for width and height.

## Acknowledgments

i want to say this was a fun experience learning this challenge overall. It just shows that i still have a lot of work to do. i like to that Youtube.com and mozilla.org for giving the opportunity to learn from the definitions and codes tutorials that made me finish the project.
